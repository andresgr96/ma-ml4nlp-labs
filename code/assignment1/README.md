# Assignment 1 - Andres Garcia

## Downloading and Installing Dependencies

1. Download .zip file
2. Unzip contents into your MA-ML4NLP-LABS/code directory
3. Then follow the steps below in the terminal:
4. Commands are in Linux CDI but should be very similar in other OS's

```

# If you dont have virtualenv installed run:

python3 -m pip install virtualenv

# Create and activate an environment:

python3 -m virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Go to my submission folder and install dependencies:

cd code/assignment1
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Running the Code
I haven't turned it into a Python file, so you will just need to run the notebook. The structure has not changed, but running the notebook will create a new folder under ./data/tests to store the dummy CONLL files.

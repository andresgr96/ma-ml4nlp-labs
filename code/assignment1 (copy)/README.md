# Assignment 1 - Andres Garcia

## Downloanding and Installing Dependencies

1. Download .zip file
2. Unzip contents into your MA-ML4NLP-LABS/code directory
3. Then follow the steps below in the terminal:
4. Commands are in linux CDI but should be very similar in other OS's

```

# If you dont have virtualenv istalled run:

python3.10 -m pip install virtualenv

# Create and activate an environment:

python3 -m virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Go to my submission folder and install dependencies:

cd code/assignment1
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Running the Code
I did not test the python file, so you will just need to run the notebook if its not functioning properly. The structure has not changed, but running the notebook will create a new folder under ./data/tests to store the dummy CONLL files.
